# crestomathy

A collection of notebooks exploring various ways to do some scientific tasks, with a bit of a geoscience flavour to some of them.

## Same nail, different hammers

A **crestomathy** is, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrestomathy):

> A chrestomathy (from the Ancient Greek χρηστός, khrēstós, meaning "useful", and μανθάνω, manthánō, meaning "learn") is a collection of selected literary passages [...]; a selection of literary passages from a foreign language assembled for studying the language; or a text in various languages, used especially as an aid in learning a subject. [...] It is different from an anthology because of its didactic purpose.

Each notebook in this unstructured collection explores a different goal, such as performing linear regression on some data, gridding irregular data to make a map (also a regression), or solving a linear algebraic equation. Each exploration involves stating the problem, then looking at different ways to do it, usually in increasingly sophisticated ways.

## Suggested additions

Topics for the future:

- Distance algorithms are a huge subject &mdash; some of these topics deserve whole notebooks to themselves. There are plenty to choose from.
  - All the Minkowski distances (L0, L1 L2, etc) and maybe octile distance
  - Coherence etc for seismic
  - Levenshtein edit distance for words
  - Canberra distance for ranked lists and other things https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_distance
  - Word/doc embedding distance (embeddings and latent spaces in general), eg https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-121/labs/HW-4%20Document%20Distance/lab.html
  - Pixel and Image distance, eg see below
  - Clock distance (23:55 and 00:05 are very close, use circular distance eg https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7ce6274c630dabd70960c6d7fdd6c580
  - Wasserstein aka Earth mover’s distance for distributions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover%27s_distance
  - Probably some others: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)
  - 3D shapes, eg https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09204.pdf
  - See table here > https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/58706/distance-metrics-for-binary-vectors/386952
  - Well logs could use cross-correlation, say. Also see https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/848/time-series-similarity-measures
  - Curves: Hausdorff distance (no order info), Frechet distance (dog leash distance), dynamic time-warp distance (not a metric as doesn’t meet triangle inequality condition), eg see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxat0UbmDo0
  - Dynamic time warping would be fun to explore; most of the algorithms are closely related.
